## Sugjestions for if I come back to this project

- [ ] allow user to set password when there is no password
	- [ ] change files index.js, auth-service.js, main.js
- [ ] stay in edit mode on reload
- [ ] set tooltip text for edit mode button
- [ ] add options (edit mode)
  - [ ] allow user to change password
  - [ ] allow user to change token duration?
- [ ] cache data in local storage to reduce requests to server (apicache + Cache-Control?)
